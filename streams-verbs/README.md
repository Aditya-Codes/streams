streams-verbs
=================

An "Object Combination" a description of what types of actor, object
and target objects are typically expected to be used with a
particular verb.

Classes in streams-verbs perform registration of activity stream verb definitions, 
allowing a stream or component to specify the type of activities deemed valid.

Resources in streams-verbs are a recommended baseline set of verb definitions for 
activities produced by multiple contributed providers, and templates for describing 
those activities.
